# Outline
A little project I made in JS, created to play songs and determine your favourite. It utilises basic features such as audio playing, objects and methods, and type-scanning functions.

# Creation
I used https://onlinesequencer.net/ to make the neat little ditties within this project. A huge thank you to them for providing such a fantastic tool!

# Issues
I have encountered a bug throughout the creation of this project that stops the audio files form being played for more than 2 seconds the first time their played. Despite my best efforts, I am still yet to solve this issue. If anybody could help me out, that would be fantastic!
